# NewsClassifierBERT

# Problem Statement:
In an era of information overload, news consumers often struggle to efficiently find articles relevant to their interests or needs. Automatically categorizing news content into distinct topics can enhance content recommendation systems, improve information retrieval, and streamline digital media workflows. This project aims to build a news topic classification system that leverages the power of transformer-based language models, specifically BERT, to accurately classify news headlines into predefined topic categories. Using the AG News dataset, the model will be fine-tuned and evaluated using accuracy and F1-score, and deployed via a user-friendly interface (Streamlit or Gradio) for real-time interaction and demonstration of its capabilities.
